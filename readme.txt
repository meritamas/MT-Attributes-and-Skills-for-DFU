These files demonstrate how one could implement MeriTamas's alternative attribute and skill system to Daggerfall Unity. (see https://forums.dfworkshop.net/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=4888)

My idea of how you could do it.
1. Download the DFU source code.
2. Open it in Unity.
3. Build the Addressables.
4. Change the code as per the model code in this GitHub repo.
5. Use Unity to build DFU.
<from this point on, carry on as if you had just downloaded a DFU build>
